    "An arbitrator might purchase and trade a more costly portfolio for the less expensive. Since the portfolios are guaranteed to be mutually cancelled at time $T$, this technique would lock an arbitration profit that is equal to the difference in the two portfolios' values (Hull, 2018). In other words, if there exists an arbitrage opportunity, we should always sell the more expensive portfolio and buy the cheaper portfolio. Moreover, many investors who engage in the same trades notice arbitration chances like this. Prices will adjust to restore parity.\n",

    "The Put-Call parity will only hold if and only if the options are European style, both call and put options must have the same strike price, the stock does not pay dividends, interest rates must remain unchanged until the expiration date, and there are no exchange or brokerage fees. For the previous examples, we are forcing $S_T$ to have an especific value. Moreover, we are also assuming that the intial price $S_0=100$, which also affects the valuation of the both call and put options. As an example, if we consider the following scenario we found that by solving for $S_T=90.5731$ with $K=110$, the Put-Call parity holds. We can do the same exercise with the rest of the variables to find the implicit value that will make the parity to hold."
