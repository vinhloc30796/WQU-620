## Question 3

### a) How many fundamental securities are there in the market?

There are many fundamental securities in the markets:

* Cash & Cash equivalents
* Accounts Receivable / Notes Receivables
* Fixed Deposits
* Equity Shares
* Debentures/ Bonds
* Preference Shares
* Mutual Funds
* Interests in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures
* Insurance contracts
* Rights and Obligations under leases
* Share-Based Payments

### b) At any given node, how many states of the world are there in the binomial tree?

Each node represents 2 states of the world:

* The state where the price goes up
* The state where the price goes down

### c) Define market completeness using parts a and b

A complete market is one where contracts can be made to gamble on all states of the world using the existing instruments

### d) Suppose the underlying stock price jumped. By jumps, we mean that it moves by a factor larger than u (or smaller than d) from 1 node to the next. Would that market still be complete? Why or why not?

That market is still complete.

* If the price has increased by a factor larger than u, then it has also increased (at least) u. That state of the world is still represented in the model.
* If the price has decreased by a factor larger than d, then it has also decreased (at least) d. That state of the world is still represented in the model.
